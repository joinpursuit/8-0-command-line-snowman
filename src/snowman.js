/*
Future Thangs
1. looking at the length of the random word and showing dashes versus the word 
2. console.log or return the phrases - remaining incorrect, letters guessed, word
3. edge case - user input should only take one character, it can only be part of the alphabet - not numbers, symbols
4. the final return should return most of the helper functions - the result of a helper function is stored as variable

Things to figure Out
1. grab the random word
2. compare the random word to the user input =  ( random word.includes(user.input)
3. if correct, another helper function to push the correct user input into something else - a correct array
4. if incorrect, another function to lower the amount of guesses in the "guesses letter"
  a. count the letter the are in the user input array?


Global Scope/State
1. correct array - the phrase and filled in spaces
2. incorrect array - user input that are not in the random word
3. the random word function
4.create an empty array
