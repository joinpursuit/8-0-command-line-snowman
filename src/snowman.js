||The Game flow process

=>  Randomly gets a word to be guessed.
1)  Declare an empty array called guessedWord = [].
2)  Do a for loop on the random word called word in order to populate the empty array, 
    guessedWord {[]}, with '_' and having the same array size as guessedWordn.
3)  Declare a varaible called WordLength to keep track of the game progress.
    =>  Game starts:
    =>  while the given WordLength greater than zero.
        
        a)  Iterate the the given word and compare each letter with the user's guessedLetter
        b)  if they are the same and the same letter not found in alreadyGuessedLetters array,
            i) Assign the guessedLetter to the corresponding index in the guessedWord array
            ii) push a guessedLetter copy in alreadyGuessedLetters array.
            iii) if the same letter is found in alreadyGuessedLetters array, display an error msg
            iv) if guessedWord is the same as the randomly given word, the user is declared the winner
        c) Otherwise if guessedLetter is incorrect, decrement the WordLength by 1 
        b)  keep asking the user to guess a letter in the word until there is no chance to guess.

=> Edge Cases (invalid input decrease the chance by 1 after each play)
if user's input, guessedLetter is equal to ''/null/undefined, display message
if user's input, guessedLetter.length is not equal to 1, or a number, ask the user to type a single 
letter and that a number or symbol is not allowed
